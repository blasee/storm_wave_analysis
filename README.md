Background
==========

On the 4th of June, 2016, an East Coast Low [1] impacted New South
Wales, causing wave overtopping and severe erosion in several areas.
This event was a very intense, low pressure system that brought over
100mm of rainfall in one hour at places along the east coast NSW.
Widespread rainfall totals exceeded 250mm along most of the NSW coast,
leading to 21 catchments experiencing flooding and nearly all of the
east-flowing rivers being affected. Periods of sustained gale force
winds (over 63km/h) were recorded along the coast, and the Sydney
Harbour experienced wind gusts of 116km/h. This intense event also
coincided with tides near the Highest Astronomical Tide, combined with
pressure-induced sea-level anomalies, and large north-easterly waves,
which resulted in local inundation of low-lying areas and widespread
coastal erosion (See [Louis et.
